### Part I: Data Science

```{r}
setwd("/Users/zachlehman/OneDrive - Queen's University/BIOL 432/") #setting my working directory to make pulling the .csv file easier
MData<-read.csv("measurements.csv") #importing the .csv file into an object called MData
library(dplyr) #preparing the dplyr package for later use
```

```{r}
MData<-MData%>% #creating a new MData dataframe using the first MData object piped to some different functions that will edit it
  mutate(Sp=gsub( #using mutate to add a new column to MData called Sp, Sp will be created by using gsub to substitude the long form names of each species with a shorter form
    "anis|edes|quus|ptenodytes|pis", ". ", MData$organism #asking the gsub function to recognize any of the given patterns, which correspond to every letter after the first in each genus. Then the gsub function replaces these patterns with a ". ", and searches the organism column of MData in order to find the patterns.
  ))%>% #piping the completed mutate function to another function
  select(Sp, limb.width, limb.length, observer) #selecting the columns that I want displayed in the new MData column in the order that I want them to be displayed in, using Sp to replace the original organism column

print(MData)
```

```{r}
write.csv(MData,"/Users/zachlehman/OneDrive - Queen's University/BIOL 432/Assign-3/Output/MeasShort.csv") #writes a new .csv file called MeasShort using the MData dataframe, and outputs it to the output folder that I created for Assignment 3
