### Visualizing Data

```{r}
library(dplyr) #load the dplyr package for future use
setwd("/Users/zachlehman/OneDrive - Queen's University/BIOL 432/Assign-3/InputData/") #setting my working directory to the location on my computer where the fallopia data csv file can be found
mydata<-read.csv("FallopiaData.csv") #reads the fallopia data csv file and puts it in a dataframe
```

```{r}
mydata1<-filter(mydata, Total>60) #filters out rows where the value for Total is less than 60
head(mydata1) #checking the first 6 rows of the new dataframe to ensure that my filter worked
```

```{r}
mydata2<-mydata1%>% #beginning to make a new dataframe using mydata1, and piping the following functions together so that I dont need to make several different objects
  select(Total, Taxon, Scenario, Nutrients)%>% #selecting the Total, Taxon, Scenario, and Nutrients columns to be the only ones seen, and in the order I decide
  mutate(TotalG=Total/1000)%>% #creating a new column called TotalG to get convert the units for Total from mg into g by dividing by 1000
  select(TotalG, Taxon, Scenario, Nutrients) #selecting the TotalG, Taxon, Scenario, and Nutrients colums to be the only ones seen, and in the order I decide
head(mydata2) #checking the first 6 rows of the new dataframe to ensure that my functions worked
```
